Algorithms Visualizer
====
An Alogithm Visualization tool for the graph algorithms.

Online Demonstration Platform
----
[Visualization Platform](http://39.108.177.106/)

Steps to Use
-----
1. Registration
2. Login
3. Search & Select the locations you interested in
4. Select an algorithm and right click the vertex of the abstract graph to select special vertex(e.g. starting vertex)
5. Left click the 'Confirm' ('确定') button, and watch the demonstration.
6. Answer questions during the demonstration, use control panel to adjust it
7. Use the 'Report' function to review your learning history


Meanings
----
* Remembering 
  * Help users recognize specific concepts in the graph algorithm by showing tips and pseudocodes.
* Understanding
  * Help users understand the general principle behind a graph algorithm, like the meanning of the iteration operations of a graph algorithm, and explain how it works using words and ﬁgures. 
  * Enable users to test that the implementation of algorithms
* Application
  * Enable users to implement the graph algorithms for some specific application.
* Analysis
  * Help users understands the relation of the algorithm with other algorithms that can solve the same or related problems by exeuting different algorithms and demonstrate them in a unified UI
  * Simultaneously display the pseudo code and the analysis of the current step while demonstrating the algorithm
  * Demonstrate the algorithm step by step.
